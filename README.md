# deterministicSOM
DeterministicSOM refers to the proposed determinized self-organizing map (SOM), which provides an automatic data analysis technique to help produce a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional input space with random eliminators. Detailded information and its application on satellite data based cloud type classification can be found in [deterministicSOM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8622558).  

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Import your data to the root folder.
3. Run the code with Weka > 3.9 by instantiating a deterministicSOM class.

# deterministicSOM
The implementation of IEEE Big Data 19 paper "A deterministic self-organizing map approach and its application on satellite data based cloud type classification". Detailded information can be found in [deterministicSOM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8622558).  

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Import your data to the root folder.
3. Run the code with Weka > 3.9.  
      *In Experiment folder: InstanceStreamClassifier.java and WindowStreamClassifier.java evaluate the landmark window model       and sliding window model, respectively.  
      *The FAHT folder contains the source code of the proposed FAHT.
